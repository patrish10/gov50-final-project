## Project thoughts

I want to do a project exploring immigration in the US and certain trends that have been witnessed over the past few years. I will be using a data set that include Refugee Arrivals, Immigrants obtaining lawful permanent status and also deportation statistics.  

```{r}
library(tidyverse)


us_immg <- read_csv("US_Immg.csv")

us_immg |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = `Refugee Arrivals`))+
  geom_line()
```
